${fileList}

## Investigation Instructions

For each file:
1. **Read the file fully** using the Read tool
2. **Trace data flows** — where does input come from? Is it user-controlled?
3. **Follow imports** — read related files (middleware, utils, shared libs) to understand the full picture
4. **Check for mitigations** — is there sanitization, validation, auth middleware, or framework protection?
5. **Think broadly** — look for issues beyond what the scanner flagged. The scanner only finds surface patterns; you should reason about logic bugs, race conditions, missing checks, etc.

## Output Format

After your investigation, output a JSON block with your findings for EACH file. Use this exact format:

\`\`\`json
[
  {
    "filePath": "relative/path/to/file.ts",
    "findings": [
      {
        "severity": "CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|HIGH_BUG|BUG",
        "vulnSlug": "the-vuln-slug-or-other",
        "title": "Brief title of the issue",
        "description": "Detailed description of the vulnerability, the attack scenario, and evidence from the code",
        "lineNumbers": [10, 15],
        "recommendation": "How to fix this vulnerability",
        "confidence": "high|medium|low"
      }
    ]
  }
]
\`\`\`

**Severity levels:**
- **CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM** — security vulnerabilities (exploitable by an attacker)
- **HIGH_BUG** — major non-security bugs that could cause data loss, corruption, outages, or seriously broken behavior
- **BUG** — notable non-security bugs (logic errors, race conditions, resource leaks) that don't rise to HIGH_BUG

**vulnSlug** can be any of the known categories OR a custom slug for issues not covered by the scanner. Use \`"other"\` as the slug prefix for novel findings (e.g., \`"other-race-condition"\`, \`"other-logic-bug"\`, \`"other-info-disclosure"\`).

If a file has no real vulnerabilities after thorough investigation, include it with an empty findings array.`;

  const prompt = `You are a world-class security researcher performing an adversarial review of vulnerability findings. Your goal is to determine, with high confidence, whether each finding is real and exploitable. You must be thorough — incorrect verdicts here directly impact security decisions.

**Take your time.** Read every relevant file. Trace every code path. Do not make assumptions — verify.

**Static analysis only.** Do NOT attempt to reproduce, exploit, or trigger any finding. Do not run the target code, send requests against any endpoint, or execute proof-of-concept scripts. Reach your verdict from the source code alone.

${projectInfo ? `## Project Context\n\n${projectInfo}\n` : ""}

${fileSections.join("\n---\n\n")}

## Investigation Process

For EACH finding, perform ALL of these steps before rendering a verdict:

1. **Read the target file fully** — not just the flagged lines, the entire file
2. **Read all imports that matter** — middleware, auth utilities, validation helpers, the framework's request pipeline
3. **Trace the data flow end-to-end** — Where does the input enter? What transformations happen? Is there validation or sanitization?
4. **Think like an attacker** — Construct a concrete attack scenario. If you can't, it's likely a false positive.
5. **Check for framework-level protections** — Next.js middleware, withSchema auth strategies, CSRF tokens, CORS headers
6. **Check the current code vs. the finding** — Has the vulnerable code been modified or removed? Check git history.
7. **Assess confidence honestly** — If you're not sure, say "uncertain". Don't guess.

## Verdicts

- **true-positive** — Real AND exploitable. You can describe a concrete attack.
- **false-positive** — Not exploitable. Name the specific mitigation.
- **fixed** — Was real but has been patched. Cite the change.
- **uncertain** — Can't determine. Explain what's ambiguous.
- **duplicate** — This finding describes the **same underlying vulnerability** at the **same code location** as another finding in the **same file** (e.g., two matchers flagged the same line range from different angles, or the same auth bypass surfaced twice with different phrasing). Set \`duplicateOf\` to the exact \`title\` of the primary finding — the one that should keep the canonical verdict. Same vuln class in a different location is **not** a duplicate.

If severity should change, set \`adjustedSeverity\`. Omit if correct.

### Duplicate rules (read carefully)

- \`duplicate\` is only valid within a single file. Cross-file similarity does **not** count.
- For any equivalence class of duplicates, **exactly one finding stays primary** with a real verdict (true-positive / false-positive / fixed / uncertain). The other(s) are \`duplicate\` with \`duplicateOf\` pointing at the primary's title.
- The primary you reference in \`duplicateOf\` **must itself have a non-duplicate verdict** in your output (or already in the file's prior revalidation). If you mark every member of a group as duplicate, all of them will be rejected.
- Pick the primary as the most precise / highest-confidence statement of the issue. The duplicates should add context in their \`reasoning\`, not repeat the full analysis.

## Output Format

\`\`\`json
[
  {
    "filePath": "exact/path/to/file.ts",
    "title": "exact title from the finding",
    "verdict": "true-positive" | "false-positive" | "fixed" | "uncertain" | "duplicate",
    "adjustedSeverity": "CRITICAL" | "HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "HIGH_BUG" | "BUG",
    "duplicateOf": "title of the primary finding (only when verdict is duplicate)",
    "reasoning": "Detailed explanation (5-10 sentences). Show your work."
  }
]
\`\`\`

**Include \`filePath\` for every verdict** so we can match verdicts to the correct file. \`adjustedSeverity\` is optional. \`duplicateOf\` is required iff \`verdict === "duplicate"\` and is otherwise ignored.

**Your reasoning is the most important part.** A verdict without thorough reasoning is worthless.`;
